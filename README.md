# Health Compass

**Health Compass** is a web application designed to predict health risks for heart disease and diabetes using machine learning models. The app provides a user-friendly interface for accessing predictions, health insights, and doctor recommendations, combining the power of data science and web technologies.

## Features

- **Heart Disease Prediction**: Utilizes a Logistic Regression model tuned with `GridSearchCV`.
- **Diabetes Prediction**: Powered by a Random Forest Classifier.
- **Well-being Insights**: Offers preventative measures and lifestyle tips.
- **Doctor Recommendations**: Fetches nearby doctors using APIs and provides a static list of recommended doctors.
- **Profile Management**: Stores and displays user health history and predictions.
- **Admin Dashboard**: Admin can monitor user data and activity.

## Tech Stack

- **Backend**: Flask
- **Frontend**: HTML, CSS, JavaScript
- **Machine Learning Models**: Logistic Regression and Random Forest Classifier
- **Data**: Kaggle datasets (Heart Disease and Diabetes)
- **Environment Management**: Conda (Miniconda3)
- **APIs Used**: Foursquare, Serp Api
